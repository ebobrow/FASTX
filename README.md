# FASTX

Does stuff with FASTA/Q files

## TODO (copying [fastx_toolkit](http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/))

- [ ] FASTQ-to-FASTA converter--Convert FASTQ files to FASTA files.
- [ ] FASTQ Information--Chart Quality Statistics and Nucleotide Distribution
- [ ] FASTQ/A Collapser--Collapsing identical sequences in a FASTQ/A file into a single sequence (while maintaining reads counts)
- [ ] FASTQ/A Trimmer--Shortening reads in a FASTQ or FASTQ files (removing barcodes or noise).
- [ ] FASTQ/A Renamer--Renames the sequence identifiers in FASTQ/A file.
- [ ] FASTQ/A Clipper--Removing sequencing adapters / linkers
- [ ] FASTQ/A Reverse-Complement--Producing the Reverse-complement of each sequence in a FASTQ/FASTA file.
- [ ] FASTQ/A Barcode splitter--Splitting a FASTQ/FASTA files containning multiple samples
- [ ] FASTA Formatter--changes the width of sequences line in a FASTA file
- [ ] FASTA Nucleotide Changer--Convets FASTA sequences from/to RNA/DNA
- [ ] FASTQ Quality Filter--Filters sequences based on quality
- [ ] FASTQ Quality Trimmer--Trims (cuts) sequences based on quality
- [ ] FASTQ Masker--Masks nucleotides with 'N' (or other character) based on quality
